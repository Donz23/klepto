#Â Klepto

Steal data from a live (mysql) database, anonymise it where defined, and put it in a new database

Vision:

`klepto --from 'root:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/fromDB' --to 'root:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/toDB' --config example.toml`

By default it just downloads and dumps everything, but you can use the config to define fields to anonymise:

```yml
---
anonymise:
    customer:
        email: EmailAddress
        first_name: FirstName
        last_name: LastName
        password: literal:1234
```

This would delete these 3 columns from the `customer` table and run `faker.Email`, `faker.FirstName`, and `faker.LastName` against them respectively. We can use `literal:[some-constant-value]` to specify a constant we want to write for a column. In this case, `password: literal:1234` would write `1234` for every row in the password column of the customer table.
