> Klepto is a tool for copying and anonymising data

Klepto helps you keep the data in your environment as consistent as it can by copying it from another environment's database. The reason for this is that you might have production data that you'd like to use for testing but you don't want to use the real customer information for your testing or local debugging. That's when Klepto comes very handy and will deal with that for you!

## Getting Started

All you need to have is a simple configuration file where you're going to define your table definition. Klepto can also try to figure that out for you (as long as your database is normalized properly).

Here is an example of how the config file should look like:

Dump all users based on the `match` field and use it for dumping their related orders:
```toml
[[Tables]]
  # Dump only matching users
  Name = "users"
  [Tables.Filter]
    # Behind the scenes it will generate the following sql query:
    # SELECT users.* FROM users
    # WHERE users.id IN ('39240e9f-ae09-4e95-9fd0-a712035c8ad7', '66a45c1b-19af-4ab5-8747-1b0e2d79339d')
    Match = "users.id IN ('39240e9f-ae09-4e95-9fd0-a712035c8ad7', '66a45c1b-19af-4ab5-8747-1b0e2d79339d')"

[[Tables]]
  # Dump only orders which are related to the matching users
  Name = "orders"
  [Tables.Filter]
    # Behind the scenes it will generate the following sql query:
    # SELECT orders.* FROM orders
    # JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id
    # WHERE users.id IN ('39240e9f-ae09-4e95-9fd0-a712035c8ad7', '66a45c1b-19af-4ab5-8747-1b0e2d79339d')
    # GROUP BY orders.id
    Match = "users.id IN ('39240e9f-ae09-4e95-9fd0-a712035c8ad7', '66a45c1b-19af-4ab5-8747-1b0e2d79339d')"
  [[Tables.Relationships]]
    ReferencedTable = "users"
    ReferencedKey = "id"
    ForeignKey = "user_id"
```

Additionally you can dump all orders based on the `match` field and use it for dumping all related users:
```toml
[[Tables]]
  # Dump only matching orders
  Name = "orders"
  [Tables.Filter]
    # Behind the scenes it will generate the following query:
    # SELECT orders.* FROM orders
    # WHERE orders.created_at BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND now()
    Match = "orders.created_at BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND now()"

[[Tables]]
  # Dump only users which are related to the orders
  Name = "users"
  [Tables.Filter]
    # Behind the scenes it will generate the following query:
    # SELECT users.* FROM users
    # JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
    # WHERE orders.created_at BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND now()
    # GROUP BY users.id
    Match = "orders.created_at BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND now()"
  [[Tables.Relationships]]
    ReferencedTable = "users"
    ReferencedKey = "id"
    ForeignKey = "user_id"
```

After you have created the file just run:

Postgres:
```sh
klepto steal \
--from="postgres://user:pass@localhost/fromDB?sslmode=disable" \
--to="postgres://user:pass@localhost/toDB?sslmode=disable" \
--concurrency=6 \
--read-max-conns=10 \
--read-max-idle-conns=4
```

MySQL:
```sh
klepto steal \
--from 'user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/fromDB?sslmode=disable' \
--to 'user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/toDB?sslmode=disable' \
--concurrency=4 \
--read-max-conns=8
```

## Prerequisites

Klepto tries to keep external dependencies to a minimum, but some functionalities requires some dependencies. Here is a list:

- Postgres: If you are using klepto to steal data from postgres databases you will need `pg_dump` installed

## Installing 

Klepto is written in Go with support for multiple platforms. Pre-built binaries are provided for the following:

- macOS (Darwin) for x64, i386, and ARM architectures
- Windows
- Linux

You can download the binary for your platform of choice from the [releases page](https://github.com/hellofresh/klepto/releases).

Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. Ideally, though, you should move it into your $PATH for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is a popular location for this.

## Supported Databases

At the moment we only support 2 RDBMS which are `postgres` and `mysql`.

### Input
- Postgres
- MySQL


### Output
- Postgres
- MySQL
- Stdout
- Stderr

## Anonymisation

Each column can be set to anonymise. Anonymisation is performed by running a Faker against the specified column.

By specifying anonymisation config in your `.klepto.toml` file, you can define which tables' fields require anonymisation. This is done as follows:

```toml
[[Tables]]
  Name = "customers"
  [Tables.Anonymise]
    email = "EmailAddress"
    firstName = "FirstName"

[[Tables]]
  Name = "users"
  [Tables.Anonymise]
    email = "EmailAddress"
    password = "literal:1234"
```

This would replace these 4 columns from the `customer` and `users` tables and run `faker.Email` and `faker.FirstName` against them respectively. We can use `literal:[some-constant-value]` to specify a constant we want to write for a column. In this case, `password: literal:1234` would write `1234` for every row in the password column of the customer table.

###Â Available data types for anonymisation

Available data types can be found in [fake.go](pkg/anonymiser/fake.go). This file is generated from https://github.com/icrowley/fake (it must be generated because it is written in such a way that Go cannot reflect upon it).

We generate the file with the following:

```sh
$ go get github.com/ungerik/pkgreflect
$ fake master pkgreflect -notypes -novars -norecurs vendor/github.com/icrowley/fake/
```
